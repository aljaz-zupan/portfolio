		Hello there! I'm a code wizard, caffeine addict, and occasional comedian. My keyboard and I have
		been conjuring up websites, applications, and software like magic. I may not be able to summon a
		unicorn, but I can make a website load faster than one. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show
		as I present to you my skills, experience, and probably a few jokes.
